User-visible changes since 2010-02-08

- changed way to do configuration; see README

- configuration changes: 
  - ~ has been renamed to ~/ and to be a string instead of a function
  - use-tablet has been renamed to use-tablet?
  - diskpath has been renamed to diskpaths

- the order of allocation of ide drives has changed; this means that
  fstab entries inside the qemu instances may need to be changed!!

  (Note that for these reasons it can be a good idea not to use the
  /dev/hd* paths to refer to disks/partitions, but instead
  /dev/disk/by-uuid/*)
