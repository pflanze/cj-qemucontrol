Programs to suspend running qemu instances from the command line, and
to start the instances so that they can be suspended, and resume them
from saved images automatically if there is a saved image.


Installation:

- perl and the Gambit-C scheme systems are required; Gambit is
  packaged in Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo, but also available for other
  systems as source or binaries on the Gambit home page.

- place the cj-qemucontrol directory wherever you like, and add it's
  path to the PATH environment variable

- run the "q-init" script to let it create the directories 
  ~/.cj-qemucontrol/ and ~/tmp/cj-qemucontrol/.


Configuration:

There can be multiple configurations per user; each configuration has
a name, the "servicename". Each configuration consists of (replace
$servicename with the actual string you have choosen):

- a file ~/.cj-qemucontrol/$servicename.scm

  See exampleconfig/example.scm and exampleconfig/example-smp.scm for
  examples of configurations that share a common base
  configuration from exampleconfig/_example-common.scm; read the
  documentation in the latter file.

- a directory ~/tmp/cj-qemucontrol/$servicename/

  This directory is automatically created, assuming that
  ~/tmp/cj-qemucontrol/ exists (which was created by q-init).

The programs assume that you mean the configuration with servicename
"default" if none is specified. This is practical when using a
separate unix user per configuration, in this case just configure the
service as "default" and you don't ever have to specify the
servicename.

The qemu binary name is "qemu-system-x86_64" by default, override in
the configuration (or change it in qemu.scm).

Note that when suspending $servicename, the RAM image is written to
~/tmp/cj-qemucontrol/$servicename/STATEFILE.gz, thus make sure that
this directory is on a file system with enough disk space.


Usage:

 q [servicename]

   start instance with control socket so that it can be suspended,
   resuming from image if present.

 q-stop [servicename]

   stop (terminate) instance

 q-suspend [servicename]

   suspend instance

 q-sendkey-to servicename key(s)
 q-sendkey key(s)

   send keyboard signals, especially worthwhile for keys that can't be typed in
   normally like ctrl-alt-f1
