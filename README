Programs to suspend running qemu instances from the command line, and
to start the instances so that they can be suspended, and resume them
from saved images automatically if possible.

This assumes that:

- every qemu instance has a name, the "servicename", which is to be
  passed to the _qemu-suspend and _qemu-sendkey scripts and set in the
  $servicename-settings.scm script. So, to create a new configuration,
  copy the files from exampleconfig/ to the cj-qemucontrol/
  directory (which is meant to be added to PATH) and replace the
  string "windows2000" in the files and their file names with the
  service name you want.

- ~/tmp exists (it probably should have 0700 permissions)

- ~/tmp/$servicename exists as well

- the qemu binary name is "qemu-system-x86_64" (change it in qemu.scm)

- perl and the Gambit scheme systems are installed; Gambit is packaged
  in Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo, but also available for other systems as
  source or binaries on the Gambit home page.
