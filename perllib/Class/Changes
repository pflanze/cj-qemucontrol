pre7
pre6

0.05pre5  
	- ucfirstletter / lcfirstletter instead of ucfirst / lcfirst
	- ç unfinished dump routine which should pretty-dump obj.
	- end Package routine returns true so it can be the last in a module.


0.05pre4  Mon,  1 Nov 2004 21:34:02 +0100
	- introduced class_array_conformize conformize-fieldname
	  functionality: now you can define fields all-lowercase if
	  you want and it'll ucfirst them for you.


0.05pre3  Sun, 31 Oct 2004 13:22:22 +0100
	- added -publica field type, and createaccessors function
	- added end function/method ('end Class::Array'),
	  which is itself calling stuff like createaccessors
	- now when subclasses define a field that already has been
	  defined by a parent class as a public/publica/protected
	  field, it is just shadowed (doesn't conflict anymore).
	  Even for exports (public fields) the new field shadows the old.
	  publica fields only shadow public fields inside subclasses,
	  not for exports, where still only public fields play a role.
	  (publica fields though are, as is usual for methods of course,
	  shadowing as usual, but well, they are not overshadowed themselves
	  by public fields since the latter do not create accessors! heh.)
	  (it's like public and publica are two separate 'namespaces')(right?)
