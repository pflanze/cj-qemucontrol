The usual 
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

If you want to make use of Class::Array::Exception, Error::Filter (from me)
should be installed, too. And if you want to use Class::Array::WithDBI,
DBI has to be installed, of course. I don't know how to handle this in
a clean (optional) way, so currently the above modules will be installed regardless
of whether the dependencies are satisfied and you have to install
the latter manually, sorry about that.

If you want to use Class::Array::XMLException with AxKit, don't miss the
files in the goodies/Axkit/ directory.
