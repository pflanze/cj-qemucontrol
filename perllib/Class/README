Make perl5 better for object oriented programming

Fast objects with access rules and typo protection.
Includes base classes for efficient DBI and exception handling
(the latter designed for use with Error::Filter).

(NOTES:

- this was written in 2001/2002; I've been using it ever since, but:

- it doesn't support multiple inheritance, or at least not well, which
  can be a hinderance

- there have popped up tons of OO frameworks since; I can't vouch for
  any of them

- for a new small project, I've decided to write a simple new OO
  framework from scratch, which does support checked keyword arguments
  to constructors, supports multiple inheritance, has some nice tools
  for creating classes on the fly, and is, I think simple; based on
  hashes again, but autogenerating accessors (looses compile time typo
  checking, but since it's mostly better to use accessor methods
  anyway, that isn't such big of a drawback). ATM it's part of:
