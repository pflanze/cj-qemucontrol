AxKit (as of 1.51) doesn't handle exceptions that it doesn't know very nicely,
it just prints them to the log and lets the standard internal server error
page be returned.

With the accompanying patch it will do better, and call the 'as_errorxml'
method on the exception object if available. When you use
Class::Array::XMLException as base class for your exceptions, this will give
nice reports in the browser.

Unlike standard axkit exceptions, Class::Array::XMLException based exceptions
don't record stacktrace information by default. To switch these on, put this
into your startup.pl (make sure startup.pl is loaded by apache, by means of
something like 'PerlRequire /usr/local/apache/conf/startup.pl' in your
httpd.conf):

 require Class::Array::XMLException;
 Class::Array::XMLException->set_stacktrace(record=>1);

(Note that for some yet unknown reason you shouldn't 'use' instead of
require, or your apache will enter an infinite loop currently.)

You should also use an error stylesheet that can make use of the 
'<rethrown></rethrown>' xml tags, like the enclosed 'error.xps'.

See also perldoc Class::Array::XMLException for more info.
